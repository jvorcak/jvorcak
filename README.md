## 🤝 What I focus on

### I can help you with a continuous migration of your legacy technologies to a modern stack

What I like the most about software development is when I get a couple of years old legacy project that serves it's customers and I get a task to continuously migrate it to something new (like React) while adding new features.

1. I usually write tests
2. Replace technologies one-by-one, documenting the reasons why
3. Repeat that process until everything including the documentation is in place

✅ I'm available for these kind of projects now, feel free to reach out to me (vorcak@webscope.io)
